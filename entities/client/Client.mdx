The EzLLM Client automatically instantiates and authenticates itself using the `.env` file.


# Env File
```sh
EZLLM_ACCESS_KEY = YOUR_API_HERE
EZLLM_SECRET = YOUR_SECRET_HERE
EZLLM_API_URL = https://api.ezllm.io # optional
EZLLM_RUN_URL = https://run.ezllm.io # optional
```

# Credentials
The `EZLLM_ACCESS_KEY` and `EZLLM_SECRET` can be found in the API Users section when creating a user.


# Manual Instantiatiation
However you may want to authenticate the SDK in a different way, in which case you have a few options

## Instantiate the Default Client
The manual client instantiation needs to be the first EzLLM call. If any other entity is called before you instantiate the Client yourself, then the entity will create its own default Client.

```py
Client(
    key='EZLLM_ACCESS_KEY',
    secret='EZLLM_SECRET',
    api_url='https://api.ezllm.io', # optional
    run_url='https://run.ezllm.io', # optional
)


# and then any further rqeuests will leverage that client (as long as it's the first instantiation of the client)
doc = Document("DOC_ID")
```


## Pass a Specific Client to Specific Resources
```py
c1 = Client(
    key='EZLLM_ACCESS_KEY',
    secret='EZLLM_SECRET',
    api_url='https://api.ezllm.io', # optional
    run_url='https://run.ezllm.io', # optional
)

c2 = Client(
    key='EZLLM_ACCESS_KEY',
    secret='EZLLM_SECRET',
    api_url='https://api.ezllm.io', # optional
    run_url='https://run.ezllm.io', # optional
)

doc = Document("DOC_ID") # will automatically use c1, as it was the first to instantiate
doc1 = c1.Document('DOC_ID')
doc2 = Document('DOC_ID', client=c2)
```
