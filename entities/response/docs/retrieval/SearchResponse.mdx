The only discernable difference is that `SearchResponseDoc` has a different type of Subdoc called `SearchSubdocs` which includes a `.score` method

```
SearchResponse(
    costs=ResponseCosts(
        total_cost=10.0,
        costs=[
            ResponseCost(cost=10, date='2024-01-12T05:38:08.266074', step='retrieve', usage=1, limitType='search', limitId='search', desc=None, reportedCost=None)
        ]
    )
    doc_groups=SearchDocOutputGroups(
        groups=[
            SearchDocOutputGroup(
                id=None
                type=all
                data=SearchResponseDocs(
                    docs=[
                        SearchResponseDoc(
                            name=Reddit Test File
                            SubDocs=1
                        )
                    ]
                )
            )
        ]
    )
)
```
