title: Sub Documents
description: 'EzLLM Sub Documents'
---

Most documents are parsed into chunks of context that can then be provide to the LLM in a variety of ways.

The size of a sub document is a balancing act between
1. having a small enough size that semantic search is effective
2. being large enough to contain useful context
3. being small enough that you can fit multiple sub documents into a single LLM call
4. large enough so as to not cut the context apart

# Fundamental Concepts
## Metadata
Sub documents also have metadata attached to them which differs depending on the file type. For example a PDF file will have metadata on which `page` a piece of context is from and a transcript will have information on when the `start_time` and `end_time` of the piece of context.


# Code Snippets

## Iterating Subdocs
the `__repr__` of subdocs truncates the output at 500 characters and displays `(MORE CONTENT ...)`

```py
for subdoc in doc.subdocs:
    print(subdoc)

# Output
SubDocs(
    subdocs=[
        SubDoc(
            index=0
            metadata={'cid': '659a54a5d9569e7b627dea93', 'did': '659a54a5d9569e7b627dea93', 'index': 0, 'wid': 'test'}
            content="""
                CONTENT FROM THIS PART OF THE DOCUMENT

                (MORE CONTENT ...)
            """
        )
    ]
)
```


## Properties
<ParamField path="metadata" type="dict">
    a dictionary of the metadata fields from the document
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="index" type="int">
    the order the subdocs were parsed from the original document
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="content" type="str">
    the text content of the subdoc
</ParamField>

### SubDoc Metadata
this is the default subdoc metadata across all Sub Document types. Different file types will include different metadata (i.e. PDF will include `page` & `x1,y1,x2,y2` coordinates for which the SubDoc was parsed)

<ParamField path="cid" type="string" required>
    The collection id it belongs to
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="did" type="string" required>
    The document id it belongs to
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="wid" type="string" required>
    the workspace id it belongs to
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="index" type="int" required>
    the order the subdocs were parsed from the original document
</ParamField>
