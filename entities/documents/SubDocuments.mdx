title: Sub Documents
description: 'EzLLM Sub Documents'
---

Most documents are parsed into chunks of context that can then be provide to the LLM in a variety of ways.

The size of a sub document is a balancing act between
1. having a small enough size that semantic search is effective
2. being large enough to contain useful context
3. being small enough that you can fit multiple sub documents into a single LLM call
4. large enough so as to not cut the context apart
