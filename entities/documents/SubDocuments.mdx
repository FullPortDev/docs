title: Sub Documents
description: 'EzLLM Sub Documents'

Most documents are parsed into chunks of context that can then be provide to the LLM in a variety of ways.

The size of a sub document is a balancing act between
1. having a small enough size that semantic search is effective
2. being large enough to contain useful context
3. being small enough that you can fit multiple sub documents into a single LLM call
4. large enough so as to not cut the context apart

# Fundamental Concepts
## Metadata
Sub documents also have metadata attached to them which differs depending on the file type. For example a PDF file will have metadata on which `page` a piece of context is from and a transcript will have information on when the `start_time` and `end_time` of the piece of context.


# Code Snippets

## Retrieving a Sub Document Directly
```py
subdoc = SubDocument("id")
```

## Iterating Subdocs
```py
for subdoc in doc.subdocs:
    print(subdoc)
```


## Props

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
    and auto generated id assigned to the subdoc
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="metadata" type="dict">
    a dictionary of the metadata fields from the document
</ParamField>

## Sub Doc Metadata
this is the default subdoc metadata across all Sub Document types

<ParamField path="cid" type="string" required>
    The collection id it belongs to
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="did" type="string" required>
    The document id it belongs to
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="wid" type="string" required>
    the workspace id it belongs to
</ParamField>
