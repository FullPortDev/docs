An Image Document leverages `gpt-4-vision-preview` model to run a variety of methods

## Valid methods
- QA
- Summarize
- Extraction
- Classification


## Examples
A cool example with this is to use it to classify and sort your images with a greater level of intelligence and flexibility than any other image classifier before.

You could even chain the services together to
1. extract `text_description` from an image
2. then have semantic search on the images

creating a next-generation image searching tool

```py
class PhotoClassifierModel:
    is_landscape: bool
    is_portrait: bool
    text_description: str
    ...


image = ImageDocument(file)


image.run(ExtractionMethod(PhotoClassifierModel))
```
