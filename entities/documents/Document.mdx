a Document represents a single file uploaded to EzLLM


## Document Parsing
depending on the selected parser, documents are typically parsed into markdown. There's a few good reasons for translating a document to markdown

1. Preserves Essential Formatting: Converting documents to Markdown retains crucial formatting, such as tables, headers, and other layout elements, which are key to maintaining the document's original presentation and readability.

2. Efficiency in Token Usage: Markdown uses fewer tokens to represent document formatting. Reducing the number of tokens increases speed, available context and reduces cost.

3. Ubiquity: Markdown is very common and as such LLMs are able to understand the content easily

## Parser types
### PDF
Converts a PDF to markdown, attempting to break pieces of context by headers, distance or when the context block hits the max `n_tokens` per context block.

It also attempts to preserve tables without splitting them.

### HTML
Converts HTML to markdown.

### TXT
simply saves the text into context blocks with `n_tokens`.

### OCR
Converts an image with text or a PDF with images to markdown.

### VTT
Creates chunks of context every `n_seconds`

# Code Snippets

## Creating a Document
```py
# doc = Document.create(name="Name Of Collection", type="embedded", ttl=24)

# the simplest way
doc = await col.upload(file)

# but you can also provide params
doc = await col.upload(file, name="My Document", type="pdf", ttl=1)

```

## Retrieving a Document
```py
doc = Collection("document id")
```

## Updating a Collection
```py
doc.update(name="New Name")
```

## Deleteing a Collection
```py
doc.delete()
```

## Searching a Document
```py
await doc.search("SEC Filings Mentioning Climate Change")
```

## Filtering a Document
```py
# returns all context from page 1
await doc.filter(page=1)
```
