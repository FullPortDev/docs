a Document represents a single file uploaded to EzLLM

# Fundamental Concepts

## Document Parsing
depending on the selected parser, documents are typically parsed into markdown. There's a few good reasons for translating a document to markdown

1. **Preserves Essential Formatting**: Converting documents to Markdown retains crucial formatting, such as tables, headers, and other layout elements, which are key to maintaining the document's original presentation and readability.

2. **Efficient Token Usage**: Markdown uses fewer tokens to represent document formatting. Reducing the number of tokens increases speed, available context and reduces cost.

3. **Ubiquity**: Markdown is very common and as such LLMs are able to understand the content easily

## Sub Documents
When a document is parsed it is split into sub documents so that pieces of context can efficiently be fit into an LLM.

## Parser types
### PDF
Converts a PDF to markdown, attempting to break pieces of context by headers, distance or when the context block hits the max `n_tokens` per context block.

It also attempts to preserve tables without splitting them.

### HTML
Converts HTML to markdown.

### TXT
simply saves the text into context blocks with `n_tokens`.

### OCR
Converts an image with text or a PDF with images to markdown.

### VTT
Creates chunks of context every `n_seconds`

# Code Snippets

## Creating a Document
```py
# doc = Document.create(name="Name Of Collection", type="embedded", ttl=24)

# the simplest way
doc = await col.upload(file)

# but you can also provide params
doc = await col.upload(file, name="My Document", type="pdf", ttl=1)

```

## Retrieving a Document
```py
doc = Collection("document id")
```

## Updating a Collection
```py
doc.update(name="New Name")
```

## Deleteing a Collection
```py
doc.delete()
```

## Searching a Document
```py
await doc.search("SEC Filings Mentioning Climate Change")
```

## Filtering a Document
```py
# returns all context from page 1
await doc.filter(page=1)
```
