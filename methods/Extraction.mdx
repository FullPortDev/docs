## Single Output
if you only want a single output then you can pass 
```py
doc.run(ExtractionMethod(schema=ExtractModel))
```

### Model Example
```py
from enum import Enum
class Classifications(Enum):
    forum='forum'
    social_media='social_media'

class ExtractModel(BaseModel):
    """extract data from text""" # these descriptions are necessary
    webpage_classification: Classifications
    n_users: int = Field(
        description="number of users on this page"
    )
```


## Tabular Output
To extract arbitrarily many structured outputs of a given format you should provide a pydantic model with one or many lists of objects as seen below

Tabular data then has convenient `output.df` functions to format as a dataframe

### Model Example
```py
class PostModel(BaseModel):
    """extract the fields for each post"""
    post_title: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="name of the post"
    )
    upvotes: int = Field(
        ...,
        description="number of upvotes"
    )
    subreddit: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Subreddit the post was from"
    )
    user: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="user who posted it"
    )

class ExtractModel(BaseModel):
    """extract data from text"""
    posts: List[PostModel] = Field(
        ...,
        description="list of posts extracted from provided text"
    )
```
