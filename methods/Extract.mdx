# Code Snippets
## Defining an Extract Model
```py
class ItemModel(BaseModel):
    """extract the fields for each item"""
    item: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="name of the item"
    )
    description: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="description of the item"
    )
    price: float = Field(
        ...,
        description="price of the item"
    )


class ExtractModel(BaseModel):
    """extract data from item"""
    items: List[ItemModel] = Field(
        ...,
        description="list of items extracted from provided text"
    )
```



# Output
would be equal to the extract model that is passed
```json
[
    {
        "item" : "Keyboard",
        "description" : "Mechanical Keyboard",
        "price" : 10
    },
    ...
]
```
