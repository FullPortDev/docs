description: Methods of document retrieval within EzLLM
---

there are two methods of document retrieval within EzLLM

## 1. Search
the search method uses embeddings & vector databases to pull semantically relevant context.


### When is Search Useful?
1. reducing costs
2. increasing speed
2. insuring relevant context is brought into the LLM

### Example Use Cases
- building your own search engine
- a Question and Answer bot based off of your documentation

## 2. Scan
The scan method filters and iterates through all context documents.

This is useful for things like summarization, structured data extraction


### When is Scan Useful?
1. thoroughness, it leverages all filtered context in the LLM
2. when there's no clear distinction between what is relevant and what isn't

### Example Use Cases
- extract structured data
- iterate through a transcript asking questions, aggregating by 5 minute intervals


## Fundamental Concepts
### Filter
The ability to filter on collections, documents, documents metadata and sub documents

This enables you to draw the exact piece of context that you want.
