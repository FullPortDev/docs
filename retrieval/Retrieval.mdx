description: Methods of document retrieval within EzLLM
---

Retrieval is the step where context is selected. A retrieval will return groupings of context that LLM methods can be run against. In most cases, a retrieval will return an array of sub-documents.

there are two methods of document retrieval within EzLLM

## 1. Search
the search method uses embeddings & vector databases to pull semantically relevant context.

{/* Search can only be performed on [SearchCollections](</entities/collections/Search>) */}

### When is Search Useful?
1. reducing costs
2. increasing speed
2. insuring relevant context is brought into the LLM

### Example Use Cases
- building your own search engine
- a Question and Answer bot based off of your documentation

## 2. Scan
The scan method iterates through all context documents.

This is useful for things like summarization, structured data extraction or any LLM method that requires a contiguous chunk of context.


### When is Scan Useful?
1. thoroughness, it leverages all filtered context in the LLM
2. when there's no clear distinction between what is relevant and what isn't
3. when you know the exact piece of context you need

### Example Use Cases
- extract structured data
- iterate through a transcript asking questions, aggregating by 5 minute intervals


# Fundamental Concepts
## Filter
The ability to filter on collections, documents, documents metadata and sub documents

This enables you to draw the exact piece of context that you want.

Search and Scan can be chained and applied to a filter

## Grouping
### Group Types
The group type has big impact in how methods are run against a retrieval.

How documents are grouped is how context is passed to the LLM.

So if you want a single output that uses the context of all documents in a filter, then group by `all`

If you want a distinct output per document isolated from the context of other documents / collections then group by `document` or `collection`

#### Group Type - All
groups all filtered documents into a single group. Supplies the context of all the documents to the LLM calls

#### Group Type - Collection
groups all filtered documents into the collection they are from. Supplies the context of each collection individually to an LLM

#### Group Type - Document
groups all filtered documents by document. Supplies the context of each document individually to an LLM.

#### Group Type - Metadata [BETA]
groups subdocs based off of there metadata. Supplies the context grouped by metadata ranges or values individually to an LLM.
